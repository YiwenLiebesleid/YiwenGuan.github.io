I worked as a machine learning engineer at Kuaishou Technology Company (Beijing) in the group of user profiling from Jul 2021 to Nov 2022. During my time in Kuaishou, I was in charge of the user profession project and live-stream recruiting project.

Before joining Kuaishou, I received my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from WPI in 2021, and was accepted as a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). Before that, I received my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ([WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/)) advised by [Dr. Jacob Whitehill](https://users.wpi.edu/~jrwhitehill/). I am interested in applications in machine learning, and my research focus is about speech processing, multimodal processing and analysis related to them.

I worked as a machine learning engineer at [Kuaishou Technology](https://ir.kuaishou.com/) (Beijing) in the group of user profiling from Jul 2021 to Nov 2022. During my time in Kuaishou, I was in charge of the user profession project and live-stream recruiting project.

Before joining Kuaishou, I received my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from WPI in 2021, and was accepted as a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). Before that, I received my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/)) in 2019, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

  <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
  <div id="selfdesc">
	I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)</a> advised by <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~jrwhitehill/">Dr. Jacob Whitehill</a>. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and their applications.</br></br>
  I worked as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://ir.kuaishou.com/">Kuaishou Technology Company (Beijing)</a> in the group of user profiling from Jul 2021 to Nov 2022. During my time in Kuaishou, I was in charge of the user profession project and live-stream recruiting project.</br></br>
  Before joining Kuaishou, I received my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from WPI in 2021, and was accepted as a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). 
  Before that, I received my bachelor degree from <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2019, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.</br>

    <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
	<div>
	<font size=3px>
		Machine learning engineer in Kuaishou Technology Company (Beijing)<br>
		<font size=2.5px>(In user profiling group, Jul 2021-Nov 2022)</font>
		<ul>
			<li>Led the user profession project, and developed the first user profession labeling system in Kuaishou by building a weakly supervised framework for strategy mining. Designed an multi-task learning model with MMoE structure and optimized the performance with transfer learning ideas.</li>
			<li>Participated in mining the "recruit intent" crowd for Kuaishou live-stream recruiting project, and analysis MRR, posterior recall, and also business metrics in ABtest.</li>
			<li>Participated in optimizing the performance of several user gender models by deploying knowledge discovery methods, and conducting model ensemble.</li>
			<li>Took part in basic feature extraction and maintenance works, and business analysis in experiments.</li>
		</ul>

    <h2>Project Experience</h2>
	<div>
	<font size=3px>
		Facial Points Detection in Videos and Real-time Cams<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Gleaned and processed video data, deployed a face detector, and trained a MobileNet.</li>
			<li>Deployed the model on real-time cam and completed a real-time facial points detection demo, which won the only fabulous prize in class.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Database System Design for COVID-19 Case Information<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Preprocessed raw data and set up a database on AWS.</li>
			<li>Designed a website that was able to display COVID-19 case information for each state on US maps.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Few-shot Learning in Driver Trajectory Data Identification<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Conducted case study and extracted features from raw trajectory data of taxi drivers.</li>
			<li>Designed and trained a Siamese model with LSTM units, the overall performance achieved 3rd place on leaderborad.</li>
		</ul>
		
		An Image Recognition Method for Plant Diseases Diagnosis<br>
		<font size=2.5px>(Thesis for graduation at USTC, Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Application, advised by Prof. Guiquan Liu, Jan-Apr 2019)</font>
		<ul>
			<li>Collected images and conducted data augmentation on the inadequate dataset.</li>
			<li>Designed and trained a shared-bottom multitask tree-CNN model that is able to classify plants in the first stage, and classify diseases in the second stage.</li>

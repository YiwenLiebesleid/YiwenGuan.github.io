  <h2><b>Brief Bio</b></h2>
  <div id="selfdesc">
  I am working as a machine learning engineer at Kuaishou Co. in the group of user profiling since July, 2021.</br></br>
  Before joining Kuaishou, I got my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in 2021, and was accepted as a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). 
  Before that, I received my bachelor degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.
  I was an undergraduate researcher in the Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Application in the early 2019, and I worked as a TA of computer programming course in USTC at the same time.</br></br>
  I am interested in data mining and machine learning, and I am considering pursuing a Ph.D in a related area.</br></br>
